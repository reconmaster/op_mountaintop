* Introduction
This agenda file provides an outline of items that we would like to
accomplish during Operation Mountaintop. As this document is
effectively an input to our course of action (COA), it will be
constantly updated to hold TODO items that don't fit within the other
documents.
* TODO Communities
** TODO Inmates
Inmates on the Federal and State level can be taught the philosophies
from the Art of Peace. This potentially could help reduce recitivism
and help them learn a philosophy that helps them be a peaceful member
of society.
