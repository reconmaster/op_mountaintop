The purpose of Aikido is to bring out the best in people. It is to
walk on a divine path. It is the way of the Universe.

#+begin_ai
[SYS]: You are an expert on Aikido in the USA.

[ME]: Please give me a comprehensive list of all Aikido dojos and
Sensei in Hawaii.

[AI]: As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information or the ability to generate a comprehensive list. However, I can suggest some resources and ways to find Aikido dojos and sensei in Hawaii:

1. Aikikai Foundation USA: The Aikikai Foundation is the official organization for Aikido in Japan. They have affiliated dojos worldwide, including in Hawaii. You can visit their website (aikikai.or.jp) and check their dojo directory for a list of Aikido dojos in Hawaii.

2. United States Aikido Federation (USAF): The USAF is a prominent organization for Aikido practitioners in the United States. They have a searchable dojo listing on their website (usafaikidonews.com) where you can search for dojos in Hawaii.

3. Hawaii Aikido Federation: The Hawaii Aikido Federation is a local organization dedicated to the practice and promotion of Aikido in Hawaii. They might have a list of member dojos and sensei on their website or through their contact information.

4. Online Dojo Directories: There are online directories specific to martial arts and Aikido, such as AikiWeb (aikiweb.com) and Aikido Network (aikidonetwork.com). These directories allow you to search and filter dojos by location.

5. Social Media and Online Forums: Joining Aikido-related groups on platforms like Facebook, Reddit, or Aikido forums can help you connect with practitioners, locals, and enthusiasts in Hawaii who might provide recommendations and details about dojos and sensei.

Remember, the information I provided may not be exhaustive, and it's always recommended to contact the specific dojos or organizations for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

* TODO [#A] Youth Outreach
Sharing the Art of Peace with the next generation ensures that this
Operation can be continued by future Aikidoka.
** TODO [#A] Aikido Youth Program
Develop a youth-oriented training curriculum for youth. This could
start as regional groups that can hopefully grow into a national and
eventually international level.
** TODO [#C] Aikido Merit Badge
Scouts might see the value in adding the Art of Peace to their
curriculum.
** TODO [#A] Summer Aikido Camps
We'd like to develop summer camps in both rural and urban settings to
reach both sides of one of the largest sources of Bias in modern
times. The Art of Peace and cross-cultural exposure can help reduce
the anonimosity that exists between people who choose to live in
cities and those who live in rural settings.
*** TODO [#B] Rural
*** TODO [#A] Urban
A lot of youth in urban cities are plagued by violence. Training
people in Aikido gives them both self-defense tactics as well as a the
mental state to avoid situtations that could potentially escalte into
a violent conflict.
