* TODO [#A] Seminars
We would like to organize an inclusive Aikido seminars that hopefully
brings different styles of Aikido together to share ideas and test how
bias can be mitigated between different styles of the supposedly same
martial art.

* TODO [#A] Youth Outreach
Sharing the Art of Peace with the next generation ensures that this
Operation can be continued by future Aikidoka.
** TODO [#A] Aikido Youth Program
Develop a youth-oriented training curriculum for youth. This could
start as regional groups that can hopefully grow into a national and
eventually international level.
** TODO [#C] Aikido Merit Badge
Scouts might see the value in adding the Art of Peace to their
curriculum.
** TODO [#A] Summer Aikido Camps
We'd like to develop summer camps in both rural and urban settings to
reach both sides of one of the largest sources of Bias in modern
times. The Art of Peace and cross-cultural exposure can help reduce
the anonimosity that exists between people who choose to live in
cities and those who live in rural settings.
*** TODO [#B] Rural
*** TODO [#A] Urban
A lot of youth in urban cities are plagued by violence. Training
people in Aikido gives them both self-defense tactics as well as a the
mental state to avoid situtations that could potentially escalte into
a violent conflict.
